### Project 10

To run the project: 

First go to the api directory in the command line and enter:
```
npm install
```

Next enter the following command. This command generates a sample database. Note: The repository includes the sample database as well. If the fsjstd-restapi.db file is missing from the api folder, this step is required.
```
npm run seed
```

Now, in the api directory, enter: 
```
npm start
```
You must leave this running in the background for the app to work properly.


Open a new command line window, go to the client directory and enter:
```
npm install
```

Finally, enter the following:
```
npm start
```
The site will run on http://localhost:3000/
